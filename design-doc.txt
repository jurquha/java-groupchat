General Design Doc:

Create Text channel program to run on top of ad hoc network.

This program will have client/server objects, but this is just nomenclature and the standard way to send and recieve things
in Java. This does not make it a "server" based application.

TODO: 
Decide if text channel is best way to demonstrate network capabilities. Is there a better application 
that we could create that would demonstrate connection and data sharing? Text channel seems a little 
overdone maybe. Also - we could do a different kind of application that could model potential 
applications (autonomous cars) that ad hoc networks have. 

Architecture:

fxml:
defines ui for application

controller:
defines functions called in fxml

server class:
class to set up listening for messages

client class:
class to set up sending of messages

main:
initialize server and client to send/recieve messages, loop
